# Overview
## What I am trying to accomplish as a Software Developer
With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) search engines, as a Software Developer I am learning how to better interact with AI to build and learn code that I am unfamiliar with. I believe it is a skill to learn to communicate effectively with AI learn new programming language. At the same time, I think it is important to focus on understanding the code rather than just regugitating it. The better I understand code, the better I can communicating with an AI tool to help me build a project. I think AI search engines are great tools for advancing technology and helping society.

## Description of Software
This is a JetBrains JetPack Compose Multiplatform Desktop Application for managing tasks and more specifically used to build small consistent habits. It utilizes the Kotlin programming language. In the program, a trigger is a signal that the user chooses to help the user start a task. For example, a task could be to exercise. The trigger to start the exercise could be right after dinner. A user can also input a distraction to avoid. In other words, the idea is that the user commits to not being distracted with the particular distraction the user chooses to input. The distraction could be any obstacle that may get in the way of the user successfully doing a specific task. The user has the ability to add or delete a task block.

# Future Work
- Another feature that could enhance the task manager is a drag and drop feature. That way task blocks could be organized by the user more easily.
- Another feature would be to provide instructions to the user so that user understand how to task manager works.
- Another feature could be to add drop downs so that user can select more and type less.

# Note: This info below is provided from the README file from JetBrains.
This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Desktop.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.
